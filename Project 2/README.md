# Computer Processor Simulation: A C/Java project

**Introduction**

This is a 5-part coding project done in our CSC 252: Computer Organization class, the overall goal of which was to help simulate a basic functioning processor that enhanced our understanding of how it worked. It was a slow build up, initially completing adders and ALUs, to later fully integrating these methods and files to run more complex methods (hence implementing the idea of abstraction). 

**Technologies used**

Java and C was used to complete this project.

**Summary**

The project was split into five parts over the course of the semester, sim 1 through sim 5. Because the project was significantly difficult to implement in its entirety by the student, the professor contributed with various classes that helped us implement our desired class. Each sim is complete with its own testcases.

[Sim 1](https://github.com/Ash-Triple9/portfolio_of_projects/tree/75db0254685a2c7d020825d72f9f7f419ed69ced/Project%202/sim1): This part aimed at completing the logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, ADD, SUB, XOR) that are present in the Arithmetic Logic Unit present in every processor. Alongisde the gates, I was also responsible for completing a 32-bit adder method that performed binary addition and subtraction using 2s complement method (2s complement method is the reason why the 32-bit adder can perform both addition and subtraction)

[Sim 2](https://github.com/Ash-Triple9/portfolio_of_projects/tree/763916a21b737c8f604c4de3b0db1564cba9bbca/Project%202/sim2): This part focused on implement half adders and full adders and create a chain of such adders that can implement ripple carry adder to handle large binary inputs

[Sim 3](https://github.com/Ash-Triple9/portfolio_of_projects/tree/763916a21b737c8f604c4de3b0db1564cba9bbca/Project%202/sim3): This sim prioritized on building the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using the multi-bit adder method and all the logic gates from the previous sim projects. It also focused on creating a multiplexer that has the capability to select one of the many ALU operations to be done.

[Sim 4](https://github.com/Ash-Triple9/portfolio_of_projects/tree/763916a21b737c8f604c4de3b0db1564cba9bbca/Project%202/sim4): This sim saw the construction of all the previous components to finally build the initial components that a basic processor contains such as Instruction Decode, ALU operations and updating the registers as necessary

[Sim 5](https://github.com/Ash-Triple9/portfolio_of_projects/tree/763916a21b737c8f604c4de3b0db1564cba9bbca/Project%202/sim5): This sim is a continuation of sim 4's construction of the the processor architecture that saw the completion of the remaining phases like Memory Writeback.
